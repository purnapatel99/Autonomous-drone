// this interrupt handler decodes incoming FrSky serial telemetry data on digital 11

// Signal is also inverted but this code flips the bits back the right way
// only works at 9600N81 with TCNT0 incrementing every 4 uS (e.g. ATmega328 @ 16 MHz)
// works without delay for character values < 128 so fine for normal ASCII
// when receiving character values > 127, the character isn't processed till the start bit of the following character is received
// so if frame ends with such a character, the frame won't be processed till the beginning of the next frame
